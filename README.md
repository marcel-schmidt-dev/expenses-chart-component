### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to create a dynamic chart using JavaScript and how to style it responsively using CSS Flexbox. I also improved my skills in handling JSON data and integrating it into the DOM. Additionally, I gained experience using Vite as a build tool and SCSS for styling.

### Continued Development

Future improvements could include adding animations to the chart bars and making the component more accessible.
